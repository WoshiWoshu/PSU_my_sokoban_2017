# PSU_my_sokoban_2017
First year mini project in C in which the goal is to recreate the famous Sokoban Japanese Game with the help of ncurses C library in terminal mode.
'X' represent the boxes to move to each 'O' destinations. Walls are represented by '#' and the player by 'P'.
Use the arrow keys (LEFT, RIGHT, UP and DOWN) to play the game.
If all boxes are on storage locations, the player wins otherwise, if none of the boxes can be moved anymore, he loses.
